Decoder is a game developed using HTML, Javascript and CSS.

A player's task is to guess a word where the letters are scrambled.
At each step of the guess process the player is told whether a letter is
in a correct position or not.

A player may setup a Timer to guess the word within 1 minute.

# Game Rules

Unscramble the letters to find the word by selecting a letter to play
and checking it against the actual word.  For each guess you are decoding
the word by being told if the letter is in the correct position or not.
Green indicate the right position.

# Instructions
- Choose to have a Timer set or not.
- Unscramble the letters by selecting the letter for each position based off
of feedback provided for each letter.
- Guess within the Time period or in 10 guesses.

# How to Play
- Set a Timer or not.
- Select the Letter for the first Letter Guess. Select the Letter for the 
second Letter guess until you've completed your Guess.
- Select the Guess button.
- Gray means the letter is not in the correct position.  Green means the
letter is in the correct position.
- When you match the letters correctly you've won.
- You can Reset the board at any time.
- If the timer is set and you have not unscrambled the word, you have lost.
- The solution will be presented whether you win or lose.
